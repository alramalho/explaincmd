# â€¼ðŸ’» explaincmd

A CLI helper that succintly explains commands to help with memorization.

## Installation

You can install `explaincmd` directly from PyPI:

```
pip install explaincmd
```

## Setup

After installation, you need to configure your Anthropic API key. You can do this by running:

```
explaincmd setup YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Anthropic API key. This will save your API key securely in a configuration file, so you don't need to set it as an environment variable each time.

## Usage

Once you've set up your API key, you can use the tool like this:

```
explaincmd your command description
```

For example:

```bash
$ explaincmd lsof -i :9002 | awk 'NR>1 {print $2}' | xargs kill -9
lsof -i :9002 | awk 'NR>1 {print $2}' | xargs kill -9
â”‚    â”‚         â”‚     â”‚                â”‚       â”‚
â”‚    â”‚         â”‚     â”‚                â”‚       â””â”€ signal 9 (SIGKILL - no mercy)
â”‚    â”‚         â”‚     â”‚                â””â”€ x = execute, args = arguments
â”‚    â”‚         â”‚     â””â”€ NR = Number of Records (skip header)
â”‚    â”‚         â””â”€ awk = "Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan" (text processing)
â”‚    â””â”€ -i = internet connections
â””â”€ ls + of = "list open files"
```
